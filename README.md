# Data-Projects
Welcome to my Data Project Repository! This repository showcases a diverse array of data science and analytics projects that I completed during my academic tenure at San Francisco State University for my Bachelor’s in Decision Science, and at UC Berkeley for my Master’s in Information and Data Science. Each project demonstrate practical application of data analysis techniques and machine learning models, aiming to provide insight from complex dataset across different domains. 

# Technologies 
Throughout these projects, I have utilized a range of technologies, including: 
* Programming Languages: Python, R
* Data Manipulation and Analysis: Pandas, Numpy, Dplyr
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, GGplot2, Tableau
* Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras

*Note: These projects are in collaboration with other teammates.*
